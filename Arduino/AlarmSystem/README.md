# Alarm system

it's a mini project i made in school, using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) platform, it's basically using the ultrasonic sensor
to detect an intrusion and it depends on a certain distance the buzzer lights up on a certain Hertz value
I had a lot of fun and i learned a lot of new things about the embedded microcontrollers
