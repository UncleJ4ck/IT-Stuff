# Potentiometer Controller

it's a mini project i made in school, using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) platform, 
I learned how to use a sensor to controle lights or anything that it's connected to your electrical circuit. 

## How it works 

Using the Arduino analog input function to control the brightness of the LED light by reading input voltage values through a potentiometer.
