# Potentiometer Controller

it's a mini project i made in school, using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) platform, it's basically controls the intensity of the LEDs depending on potentiometer position. 
I learned how to use a sensor to controle lights or anything that it's connected to your electrical circuit.
